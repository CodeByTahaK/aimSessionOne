NEW GAME:

# Quiet Time Game

**Quiet Time Game** is a fun and interactive game designed to encourage kids to maintain low noise levels during study time in a classroom setting. The game uses microphone input to measure noise levels and provides visual and motivational feedback to help students stay quiet.

## Features

- **Noise Level Detection**: Uses a microphone to detect the current noise level in the room.
- **Visual Feedback**: Displays a noise meter (color bar) to represent the current noise level:
  - Green: Quiet
  - Orange: Moderate noise
  - Red: Loud noise
- **Score System**:
  - Rewards points for maintaining silence.
  - Deducts points for moderate or loud noise.
- **Motivational Messages**: Displays encouraging messages periodically to keep students engaged.
- **Timer**: Tracks the session duration and displays the remaining time.
- **Rewards**: Provides rewards (e.g., stars) for maintaining silence for extended periods.
- **Customizable Settings**:
  - Adjustable thresholds for quiet and loud noise levels.
  - Session duration can be set by the teacher.

## How It Works

1. The game listens to the microphone input and calculates the noise level.
2. Based on the noise level:
   - If the noise is below the quiet threshold, the score increases.
   - If the noise is moderate, the score decreases slightly.
   - If the noise is loud, the score decreases significantly, and a warning message is displayed.
3. A noise meter at the bottom of the screen provides real-time visual feedback.
4. Motivational messages are displayed every 30 seconds to encourage students.
5. The game ends when the session timer runs out.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository or download the source code.
2. Install the required Python libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install pygame sounddevice numpy


1. Number Guessing Game
How to Play:
The game generates a secret number between 1 and 100.
The player guesses the number, and hints are provided based on how close the guess is.
The difficulty affects how vague the hints are.
Keep track of past guesses and aim to guess the number in fewer attempts than your best score.

Prompts Used:
Prompt for creating the game: "Create a Python number guessing game with a hot/cold hint system, tracking past guesses, and adding difficulty levels. Make it visually appealing with Tkinter."
Additional features: Added a leaderboard for best scores, animated feedback on hints, and a reset function after guessing correctly.

How to Run:
Just run python or python3 gameOne.py in your command line (windows)
Start guessing by entering a number and clicking "Submit Guess."

2. Pirate Ship Defender (Space Invaders Variant)
How to Play:
The player controls a pirate ship at the bottom of the screen using the left and right arrow keys.
Shoot cannonballs (space bar) to destroy incoming enemy ships.
Enemies drop from the top of the screen, and if too many pass the playerâ€™s ship, the game is over.
The game ends if more than 50 enemies pass the barrier, or the player loses all their lives.

Prompts Used:
Prompt for creating the game: "Create a Space Invaders-style game where the player defends against incoming enemies, with a pirate ship theme. Add a feature to count enemies passing the barrier, and display a 'You Lose' message."

Additional features: Added background images, realistic visual effects, and a game-over screen with an option to restart.

How to Run:
Just run python or python3 gameTwo.py in your command line (windows)
Run the script in Python 3.x, and press 'S' to start the game.
Use the left/right arrow keys to move the ship and the space bar to shoot.
